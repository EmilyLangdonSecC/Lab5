I started this website by creating a header. I made sure it was responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes by making the nav bar display as a dropdown menu on small screens. I also made the header sticky so it's always at the top of the screen.

Whenever I added something to the website, I coded it to work on mobile and then used media queries to make it work on desktop. This is called mobile first design.

I used variables for aesthetic properties like fonts, colours, etc. This would make it easy for me to change any of these in the future. I also used custom Google fonts.

I used the clamp property to implement fluid typography. This will ensure that the text size responds well to changes in screen size.

I created a grid with cards to display featured artist. Each card contains an image of its respective artist and a p element for their name. The cards' shadow changes when hovering over them, making them more interactive.

I used the section element to divide the website into relevent sections wherever other elements could not be used (ie header, nav, etc).
